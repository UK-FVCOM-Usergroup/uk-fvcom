Proposed changes and other issues to consider

Add support for offline Sediment and FABM at the same time
Transfer advection routine to use single function such as the adv_scal.F and monitor performance
Include RK for advection of FABM variables. This requires mirroring changes in internal_step as well as create a fabm_adv_rk.F
Use findent to indent all files to make reading code easier?
RK doesn't allow for MPDATA or semi-implicit
SMEAN1 (on nodes) doesn't get updated ever. Not sure what it role is in the advection routine other than increasing accuracy?
our approach to recalculating fabmmean seems more appropriate

The implementation of advecting only a subset of FABM interior variables is missing from this repo
