----------

The main FABM website is http://fabm.sourceforge.net.

The ERSEM biogeochemical model can be requested from the Shelf Seas Biogeochemistry website: http://www.shelfseasmodelling.org.

Development of FABM coupling for the ERSEM biogeochemical model is taking place in this repository, under the [FABM-ERSEM](https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/fvcom/uk-fvcom/tree/FABM-ERSEM) branch.

We always aim to maintain this branch in sink with the latest FVCOM release. FVCOM4.3 is now included in [FABM-ERSEM 4.3](https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/fvcom/uk-fvcom/tree/FABM-ERSEM_v4.3) branch. This branch includes all the developments that have been carried out by partners of the uk-FVCOM group.
