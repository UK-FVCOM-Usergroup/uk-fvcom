A) To choose the compiler manually by user, in folder FVCOM_source, copy file make.inc_example to make.inc and then modify make.inc for the compiler you want use.

B) To choose the compiler automatically by system, run shell file configure.sh in folder Configure to recreate a file named make.inc in folder FVCOM_source (*):

1. Compiling with series run:
./configure.sh series

2. Compiling with parallel run:
./configure.sh parallel

C) After A) or B), you can edit file make.inc in folder FVCOM_source for your desired setup (FLAG_1 to FLAG_41 and path of lib)

Then run make in folder FVCOM_source to compile FVCOM_source code.

* Only intel compilers for Linux are tested. Others are need to be tested for compilers on different system.
